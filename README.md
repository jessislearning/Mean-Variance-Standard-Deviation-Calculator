# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is a Data Analysis with Python project from freeCodeCamp. The boilerplate and instructions can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator


For this Calculator, the input is a list of 9 digits. A 3x3 numpy matrix is created, and the mean, variance and standard deviation are calculated per row, per column, and for the entire matrix ("flat"). The output is a dictionary that contains these calculations.

If the input is anything other than 9 digits, the code also raises a ValueError exception, with a message saying "List must contain nine numbers."
